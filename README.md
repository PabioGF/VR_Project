## Functionalities
- First of all, the application lets you choose whether to visit the monument at day or at night.
- Once it has been chosen, there are different explanations of the monument and its historical context. It is also possible to see the monument both reconstructed and in its current state clicking a button.
- There is also a lantern in the night scene to be able to see in some darker places.
